# BeenThere Project

4 months ago I decided to change my professional path and became Frontend Developer.
I complited HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses, but I am not stopping here. Now I am learning Reack and in the near future I will improve my skills with advances CSS and Sass course.

This project is my first self-made one. I decided to show off with application to mark places using pins on map (see in try-container - for now only prototype).

Road map of BeenThete:

- worked with DOM manipulations to make my site lively: cookies, display and hide sign-up form, bubble comment when mouse enter on pin img (display and hide), testimonial container carousel dots,
- to create a real-life project I used IntersectionObserver for sticky navigation after user scrolls above the hero section and also for revealing sections while scrolled or click from navigation.
- the inviting "join us" button shines through a loop that manipulates the degree of linear-gradient of background color,
- the site's showcase is infinite carousel delayed 3s with asynchroniuos setInterval, which works using if...else logic,
- OOP and external library (leaflet) for marking pin on map fill form,
- real-life footer with social media icons and links,
- log-in as separate site,
- copyrights up to date with getFullYear() method,
- site is responsive for majority of viewports.
